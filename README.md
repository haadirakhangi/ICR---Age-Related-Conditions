# ICR---Age-Related-Conditions
This is my implementation of the 'ICR- age related conditions' competition on kaggle. 

Competition Description:
This competition aims to predict if individuals have any of three medical conditions (Class 1) or none of them (Class 0) using health characteristics data. The goal is to create a predictive model based on these measurements, eliminating the need for a lengthy and intrusive patient information collection process. By encoding key characteristics, the model can identify potential patient conditions while maintaining patient privacy. This research will contribute to understanding the relationship between specific characteristics and medical conditions, assisting researchers in developing more efficient diagnostic methods and improving patient care.
