# ICR---Age-Related-Conditions

Goal of the Competition
The goal of this competition is to predict if a person has any of three medical conditions. You are being asked to predict if the person has one or more of any of the three medical conditions (Class 1), or none of the three medical conditions (Class 0). You will create a model trained on measurements of health characteristics.

To determine if someone has these medical conditions requires a long and intrusive process to collect information from patients. With predictive models, we can shorten this process and keep patient details private by collecting key characteristics relative to the conditions, then encoding these characteristics. This research will contribute to understanding the relationship between specific characteristics and medical conditions, assisting researchers in developing more efficient diagnostic methods and improving patient care.
